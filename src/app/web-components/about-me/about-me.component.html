        <p class="lead">
          Hi! I'm <span class="highlight">Juan Reyes</span>, a Mechatronics
          Engineering graduate from McMaster University with a strong passion
          for building complex systems that sit at the intersection of hardware,
          software, and human centered design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently serve as a
          <strong>Technical lead on the McMaster Exoskeleton</strong> team,
          where I guide a team of 6 students through the embedded system
          architecture and firmware development for a lower-limb robotic
          exoskeleton. In this role, I've learned how to translate high-level
          goals into concrete technical direction, mentoring teammates, reviewing
          designs, and ensuring our software and electronics integrate reliably
          as a complete system. Previously, I held the role of Control Systems
          Lead, where I helped derive the exoskeleton's system equations and
          controller models, including adjustments for human applied forces and
          real world dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond academic teams, I spent
          <strong>16 months at Accipiter Radar</strong>, where I developed a
          strong appreciation for full system ownership and independent learning
          in a professional engineering environment. There, I worked across
          disciplines, designing and testing electronics, validating radar
          hardware, and contributing to PCB design for new systems. I also led
          and supported software projects, including full-stack web development
          for customer portals, database design and testing for internal
          hardware and software BOM automation tools, and performance analysis
          of PostgreSQL systems. Alongside technical work, I supported quality
          assurance initiatives, contributing to training development,
          documentation, and internal audits under an ISO aligned quality
          management system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Across all of these experiences, what drives me most is the challenge
          of learning quickly, adapting to new technologies with minimal
          guidance, and seeing how individual components come together into
          reliable, real-world systems. Whether I'm writing embedded firmware,
          designing control algorithms, or building backend infrastructure, I'm
          motivated by curiosity, collaboration, and the satisfaction of solving
          difficult problems end to end.
